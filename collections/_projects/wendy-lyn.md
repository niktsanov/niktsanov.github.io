Wendy Lyn is known as the “Insider’s Insider” for her hard-won access to the international culinary community from having worked as a PR & Restaurant Consultant to the some of the biggest chefs in the world and launching the first US Michelin Guide. She is sharing her experience on her website as well as providing tours for people who enjoy food and to travel. My responsibilities were to provide her with a new fresh look for her website, add features such as related posts, tours' landing page, tours' pages, booking form and give her advice on how to get more recognised on Google (SEO).
