The purpose of the foxes-and-rabbits system is to simulate interactions between foxes and rabbits within a certain area(window). The main interactions consist of rabbits being eaten by foxes, therefore foxes are considered “predator” and rabbits as “pray”. Moreover, the different animals have different age to which they can live and if they die, they are removed from the simulation. There are hunters and wolf packs which are also considered “predators”. This is an university project for my first yeah at University of Stathclyde. The whole source and explanation is available on GitHub.
