Making a personal website has been on my mind for some time. I wanted to have a clean modern design that is simple to navigate and shows my work to potential clients. I am a huge fan of utility-first css framework especially of TailwindCSS. Because of it, I managed to build the whole design quickly and host it on Github Pages.
