We Are Still Open is a non-profit initiative created to support local quality food businesses struggling to survive the COVID-19 crisis by connecting their take-out or delivery options directly to consumers. It was built in collaboration with Tom van Oorschot (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/tomvo/" target="blank">@tomvo</a>) and Tarik Coralic (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarik-coralic/" target="_blank">@TarikCoralic</a>). The initial version was built for two days and we gradually improved the design and added more functionalities.
