In the emails, I’m sharing thoughts, news and more about PhpStorm, so make sure you’re not missing anything by signing up for the newsletter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to help you improve your PhpStorm workflow by synthesizing useful resources, news, plugins and much more. Over time, your use of the IDE will drastically change and your performance will be significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I start, I want to present you with a few principles that I enforce when working with the IDE (If you follow Caleb’s amazing newsletter about working with VS Code (&lt;a href=&quot;https://makevscodeawesome.com/&quot;&gt;www.makevscodeawesome.com&lt;/a&gt;), you might be aware of some of them):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer distractions on the screen, more productive workflow.
The theme and font are important! (I cannot stress this enough! You’re going to be staring at the IDE for hours, you must make it easy on your eyes and brain!)
Shortcodes, shortcodes and more shortcodes! (If you can automate some actions, you should do it. There are many services that we, as developers, use that automate tedious tasks, we should do the same for our IDE).
Don’t rely on your IDE blindly! (You’ll find out what I mean at a later point).
These are the core principles I follow when working with a specific IDE. If you don’t agree with them, that is perfectly fine! Consider this newsletter as an alternative point of view that might be helpful to you as well! The good thing about it, you can apply most of the information here to other JetBrains’s products - Intellij IDEA, WebStorm, PyCharm and more (you can find a list of their products on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;). The beauty of the JetBrain’s ecosystem is that their products are consistent, most of the settings are shared between them, so you can easily find your way. I’m not sponsored to say all of this, just my opinion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For students and teachers, you can get access to PhpStorm for free! More information can be found on JetBrains’ website - or a simple Google search will do the trick as well. However, the purpose of these free licenses is for education only. If you are planning on using it on a commercial project, you’ll have to purchase an individual license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note, I cannot express how thankful I am to the amazing PHP community! I’ll try to be as much transparent as possible about the newsletter by sharing statistics that might be helpful for those of you that want to start something similar. You can follow me on Twitter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NikolayTsanov&quot;&gt;@NikolayTsanov&lt;/a&gt;) for more of the insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado let’s start with the first topic of the newsletter - getting rid of the distractions and styling your IDE (not only for you to look cool in front of your colleagues, but also important for your productivity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: for windows users, some of the shortcodes that I’ll reference might be a bit different - when I mention the &lt;strong&gt;Cmd&lt;/strong&gt; key, you need to replace it with &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl&lt;/strong&gt;. (More on the keymaps between PC and macOS can be found on the Microsoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/970299/keyboard-mappings-using-a-pc-keyboard-on-a-macintosh&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Table of contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic I - Aestetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removing the Panels and Floating Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving the Sidebar (Projects Explorer)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Picking up a Theme (determine the best theme based on your surrounding)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Picking up a Font (determine the best font for readability)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better Icons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;removing-the-panels-and-floating-tools&quot;&gt;Removing the Panels and Floating Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned a few times already, panels are distractions. Hiding them will be more beneficial to you. If you need them, you can always toggle or assign a shortcode for easy access. In PhpStorm, there are plenty of them, most of which you’ll probably never use. This is what you’ll most probably have at the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, your attention is “hijacked” by the information spilt on your screen. We’ll start off by removing the bars (Navigation Bar and Status Bar). Easiest way to do so is by going &lt;strong&gt;View &amp;gt; Appearance &amp;gt; Status Bar&lt;/strong&gt;. All of these options are available by also doing &lt;strong&gt;Navigate &amp;gt; Search Everywhere &amp;gt; type “status bar” &amp;gt; Show Status Bar (to off)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! Now that we have the Status Bar removed, we can also get rid of the Tool Window Bars (&lt;strong&gt;View &amp;gt; Appearance &amp;gt; Tool Window Bar&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Navigate &amp;gt; Search Everywhere &amp;gt; type “tool window bar” &amp;gt; Hide Tool Window Bar (to on)&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It already looks way better than before. However, there are still two panels left. By doing &lt;strong&gt;View &amp;gt; Appearance &amp;gt; Navigation Bar&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Navigate &amp;gt; Search Everywhere &amp;gt; type “navigation bar” &amp;gt; Show Navigation Bar (to off)&lt;/strong&gt; we get rid of a huge portion of the taken space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we are left with the floating browsers. Let’s be honest, probably nobody uses them that often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can be removed simply by going to the PhpStorm’s settings and deselecting them. &lt;strong&gt;PhpStorm &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Tools &amp;gt; Web Browsers&lt;/strong&gt;, alternatively &lt;strong&gt;File &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Tools &amp;gt; Web Browsers (on Windows and Linux)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally end up with a clean and distraction-free IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, there is still a bit more left. On the bottom part of the window you can see the breadcrumbs. They are considered helpful by many, however, I personally never look at them (so I tend to hide them). It is your decision to make, to hide them you can just do &lt;strong&gt;Navigate &amp;gt; Search Everywhere &amp;gt; type “breadcrumbs” &amp;gt; Show Breadcrumbs (to off)&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;PhpStorm &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Editor &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Breadcrumbs &amp;gt; Show breadcrumbs (on macOS)&lt;/strong&gt;, alternatively &lt;strong&gt;File &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Editor &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Breadcrumbs &amp;gt; Show breadcrumbs (on Windows and Linux)&lt;/strong&gt;. In the settings, you can see that you have the option where to place them (top or bottom) and for which languages to show them. Completely up to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might ask yourself, “Why didn’t he hide the tabs?”. I enjoy using the tabs, there are some tricks that we’ll explore later in the series on how to limit the number of them and how to easily switch left and right using the keyboard. When working on multiple files, I find myself switching often between them (even with split screen). Using less brainpower to remember which file I have to search and switch to every time I’m working is something that I enjoy and you’ll probably notice it as well in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-the-sidebar-tool-window-or-project-explorer&quot;&gt;Moving the Sidebar (Tool Window or “Project” Explorer)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are like me, you’re probably toggling the sidebar from time to time. You probably have a shortcode (keymap) that you use all the time (we’ll explore this at a later point). What happens when the sidebar is on the left is that it pushes the code every single time you make it visible or hide it. Ideally, you won’t need it that often, however, for the times that you actually need it, I prefer to have it on the right side. It is pretty straightforward, &lt;strong&gt;⚙ (Gear Icon) &amp;gt; Move To &amp;gt; Right Top&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, your IDE starts getting in shape. However, still long way to go! In the next email, we’ll explore themes (why you should pick up based on your surrounding), fonts and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/phpstorm-but-better-getting-rid-of-the-distractions/10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-time&quot;&gt;Next Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to keep the reading time relatively small. So some of the topics that I’ll cover will be split into multiple parts. Next time, I’ll cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Picking up a Theme (determine the best theme based on your surrounding)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Picking up a Font (determine the best font for readability)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better Icons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ll slowly start getting into more complex material (PSR-12, shortcodes, settings and more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-useful-materials&quot;&gt;More Useful Materials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christoph Rumpel has nicely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SUtEnMj1ws&quot;&gt;illustrated&lt;/a&gt; some of the concepts that I’ve covered in this email. Make sure to check him out!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to find more on how to set up PhpStorm with Xdebug &amp;amp; Docker, you can find Derick Rethans’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/433218463&quot;&gt;walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; interesting. Derick is also the creator of Xdebug, so he’s the best person you can find for the job.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For the people using Laravel’s Homestead, Daniel Verner’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://42coders.com/how-to-set-up-debugging-with-phpstorm-and-homestead/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on this topic will be of a good use!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PhpStorm is known to have some performance issues. Project Lanai is a joint effort between JetBrains and Oracle that looks to solve this. Check Alex Vanderbist’s (member of Spatie) &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexvanderbist.com/2020/enable-early-access-metal-support-for-jetbrains-ides/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on this topic.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Rt7lUs235zuIFyj9V4nJcA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Medium’s website with a nice contrast between the menu bar and the page&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medium’s website with a nice contrast between the menu bar and the page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no magic in that. This can easily be achieved by using only one line of code inserted directly into the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag of your page. This will suggest to the browser to use this colour rather than the default one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;theme-color&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#ffffff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other popular websites using this:&lt;/p&gt;

I do like it when it works, but it requires a lot of tinkering before getting the wanted results. Before I start, I must say that I am not an expert in any way with Google Tag Manager, the suggested approach below is just an example of how one can go about solving an issue we experienced working on a project that used VueJS to present the user with a cookie consent banner. We had to provide the user with the option to opt-out or opt-in from certain groups. The “statistics” group included Google Analytics. There might be a prettier solution, however, most of the articles out there only cover scenarios where the website already uses a service such as Cookiebot, OneTrust or other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9620/1*T-iADds-1lCncd92GIIyhA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Luke Chesser - Google Analytics&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@lukechesser?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Luke Chesser&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/analytics?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started-with-google-tag-manager-and-google-analytics&quot;&gt;Getting started with Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we need to set up Google Tag Manager into our existing project and import Google Analytics. Bear in mind, it is really important to remove any previous code related to tracking before adding GTM (I will talk about this later). We will start by adding a new account to Google Tag Manager. For account name, you can choose the name of your project, the name of the company you are working for or anything else you like. Make sure to keep it consistent, soon you might end up with a dozen of projects!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4760/1*FxjEewvDvUfz1VIuToyMmA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Setup account’s information&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setup account’s information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The account will be the main holder for the containers. A container is simply a bundle of scripts that will execute following some criteria. An example of having multiple containers for one account is if you want to split the various scripts that will run on the main domain and the subdomain. Therefore, you will setup a container for example.com and staging.example.com . We will also pick Web as a targeted platform. Everything here can be changed later on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4628/1*U_8kWJlcdJIrumn57fEoUw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Setup a container for the current account&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setup a container for the current account&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you are done setting up everything, you will be prompted with code snippets that you can directly import into your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2824/1*sU6UG7e8Ll3-t9jNIGuCXg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: You do not need the second code snippet if you are not planning on supporting older browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I prefer using a dedicated package that will act as a wrapper around Google Tag Manager. The package will provide one more level of abstraction. Since the project uses VueJS heavily, I came across this lightweight package &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mib200/vue-gtm&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mib200/vue-gtm&lt;/a&gt; that also automatically loads the GTM script. There are also some additional configuration that you can do, such as enable or disable it based on a condition and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install vue-gtm --save
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then import it in your main script, in my case app.js&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueGtm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;vue-gtm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VueGtm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;GTM-P42GL2L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we want to make sure that we only load GTM and nothing else! This is really important, we do not want to track the same thing twice! A neat way to check for this is by using the Tag Assistant extension, available only on &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-by-google/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk?hl=en&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4248/1*yrkyB_BsXlQGU3N2zMb5uQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, navigate to the url of your site and enable the extension (you will probably need to reload when you enable it). You should be displayed with only one tag that has been fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*JefPeTP0rBDVh59Odqm3jw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you might also end up with a “HTTP response code indicates tag failed to fire: Status 404. This could be due to an empty or un-published container”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ceHSBNsYgZfc9f-lWcXbRw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warning is pretty self-explanatory, make sure you publish your container or preview it. Both will work. Make sure your container if published for production!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*pj1XTVkRfECk2YbLNaSNWw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have everything up and running, we can add our Google Analytics Tracking ID to GTM (I assume you already have such, it should be in the format UA-XXXXXXXXX–X). To add a script to your site you need to add a tag in Google Tag Manager. Your tag’s configuration should looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*5wFeLFEoylEmpFZhs-Ca2Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a tag to be fired (a script to be loaded) on your website, you need to set up a trigger for it. The trigger that we are going to set will read a value from a cookie and based on that fire the tag. Therefore, if the tag is not fired then the user would not get GA cookies set in the browser. We want to fire the tag on all pages so we will select “Page View” as a trigger. But, we also want to restrict this by checking whether we are allowed to fire the tag or not. This can be done by selecting the “Some Page Views” option and adding a new variable or choosing from the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*aHEpU9Rb-9KN5CPPerWDkw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we would want to make a custom variable that holds the consent value. Now, there are few options that we can pick. The first one is to make a new variable of type “Custom Javascript” and have some code inside that reads from the document.cookie . While this is a realistic approach, it requires placing logic inside GTM, which I am not fan of. A better approach, in my opinion, is to read from a global javascript variable. As far as I know, most of the popular cookie consent services use a similar approach. This global variable can be controlled from the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HInXP6vnV_mmlozf72znDg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2880/1*k9_Mz70QsvsJRWizpwrvDg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, our Page View Trigger should fire only when the user consented to statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KKZzzG_YyvJTpeamJdmKxg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are pretty much done. Now, we only need to add the trigger to the tag we made. On the website, you can present the user with a custom banner, popup or anything else you want. When the user agrees or declines, you can set a cookie which will keep track of the consent. This cookie can be used to set the global variable (every time the page reloads). The good thing now is that GTM does not rely on a cookie, but rather on a global variable that can be set in various ways: local storage, cookies etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amazing part of Google Tag Manager is that it is highly customizable. There are various ways of implementing a GDPR form with it. To finish of, here is a list of great resources where you can explore more about GDPR and GTM:&lt;/p&gt;

I do like it when it works, but it requires a lot of tinkering before getting the wanted results. Before I start, I must say that I am not an expert in any way with Google Tag Manager, the suggested approach below is just an example of how one can go about solving an issue we experienced working on a project that used VueJS to present the user with a cookie consent banner. We had to provide the user with the option to opt-out or opt-in from certain groups. The “statistics” group included Google Analytics. There might be a prettier solution, however, most of the articles out there only cover scenarios where the website already uses a service such as Cookiebot, OneTrust or other alternatives.</summary></entry></feed>
